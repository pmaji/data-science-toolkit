## Introduction

Welcome! The purpose of this repository is to serve as stockpile of statistical methods, modeling techniques, and data science tools. The content itself includes everything from educational vignettes on specific topics, to tailored functions and modeling pipelines built to enhance and optimize analyses, to notes and code from various data science conferences, to general data science utilities. This will remain a work in progress, and I welcome all contributions and constructive criticism. If you have a suggestion or request, please [use the "Issues" tab](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/issues) and/or reach out to me [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/ByPaulJ), and I will respond expeditiously! 

Note: GitHub often has trouble rendering larger .ipynb files in particular. If you find that you are unable to view one of the jupyter notebooks linked below, I recommend copy and pasting the result into [jupyter's nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), which will take you to a viewable link like [this one here for my "Visualization with Plotly" notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/blob/master/eda-and-visualization/viz_with_plotly.ipynb?flush_cache=true). Note that if you want to ensure that you are viewing the most up-to-date version of the notebook with nbviewer, you should add `?flush_cache=true` to the end of the generated URL [as is described here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29034001/i-updated-my-ipython-notebook-gist-but-why-didnt-nbviewer-update); otherwise, your link risks being slightly out-of-date.
